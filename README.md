# distortion-pedal-v1

This project is an expansion on [this JUCE tutorial](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_dsp_convolution.html), after having gone through all the steps.
This project serves to play around with the parameters and components of the processor chain, to see how interesting of a distortion sound we can get.
